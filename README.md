Instructions and background information on our repository:

In addition to the Readme file, our repository "CollaborativeResearchProject" contains two BibTeX files, an R file, an RMD file, a PDF file and an HTML file. The PDF and the HTML were created using the knit function of R Studio.

# How to proceed with the files in our repository:

1. The RMD file requires to run the R file first for loading and cleaning the data. The R file saves the organized and cleaned data files in the working directory and the RMD file opens them from the same folder after the working directory is set correctly.

2. The R Packages used for the proposal are cited in the BibTeX file "Packages.bib". As the BibTeX file and the RMD file are dynamically linked, it is important to save both files again in the same folder when running the RMD file.  

3. The RMD file is running descriptive and inferential statistics if the previous steps were followed.


# Content of our Repository:
The focus of our research is the identification of the determinants of HIV/AIDS and for this assignment we propose 3 models to test what factors influence HIV/AIDS incidence and prevalence at the macro level.

We have used data from the World Bank and the UNAIDS database. The data of the WDI is publicly available on the Worldbank Website and is loaded in our R file by using the WDI package. 

The Rmd File has the following structure:

* Preparation
* Descriptive Statistics
* Inferential Statistics
* Limitations
* Bibliography
* Appendix

# Task for Assignment 3:

The task for this assignment was to:
* gather web based data from at least two sources
* merge the data sets
* conduct basic inferential statistics on the data to address a relevant research question and briefly describe the results       including with dynamically generated tables and figures

Word count:
1,500 words maximum

Deadline for submission:
